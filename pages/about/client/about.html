<h1>About Us!</h1>
<p style="font-family:'Noteworthy'; font-size:200%">  Vote University is an app which connects college students and their respective political representatives by receiving your legislative opinions and sending it directly to your representative! Your inputs gathered in a report card which you will use to vote! Finally our voices, as the future of this great nation will no longer be silent, but heard. This app was created by our founder, Elias Rosenfeld, a college student to empower other college students to make change, and make it more efficiently.   </p>
